## Installation

### 1. Install Python

### 2. Install Required Packages

Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following commands to install the necessary packages:

```bash
pip install pygame vgamepad

After installing the required packages, you can run the application by executing:

```bash
python main.py
```

### 4. Usage

- Connect your game controller (Xbox 360 or DS4) to your computer.
